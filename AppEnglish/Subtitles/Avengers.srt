1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,460
There was an idea...

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,500
to bring together a group of remarkable people...

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,000
to see if we could become something more.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,100
So when they needed us, we could fight the battles...

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
that they never could.

6
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,980
In time you'll know what it's like to lose.

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,300
To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail all the same.

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,440
Dread it.

9
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,680
Run from it.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,460
Destiny still arrives.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,760
Evacuate the city.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,860
Engage all defenses.

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,120
And get this man a shield.

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,020
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe.

15
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,920
But this...

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,200
Does put a smile on my face.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:00:00,000
Who the hell are you guys?
