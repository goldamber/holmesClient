1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:07,750
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below

2
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:14,815
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:23,316
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke

4
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:30,713
Keep watching over Durin's son

5
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:47,091
If this is to end in fire

6
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,339
Then we should all burn together

7
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:56,327
Watch the flames climb high into the night

8
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,000
Calling out father, stand by and we will

9
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:08,901
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

10
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:18,720
And if we should die tonight

11
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,929
Then we should all die together

12
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:28,345
Raise a glass of wine for the last time

13
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:34,365
Calling out father, prepare as we will

14
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:40,451
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

15
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:47,098
Desolation comes upon the sky

16
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,119
Now I see fire, inside the mountain

17
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:59,294
I see fire, burning the trees

18
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:05,670
And I see fire, hollowing souls

19
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:12,210
I see fire, blood in the breeze

20
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:17,307
And I hope that you'll remember me

21
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,365
Oh, should my people fall

22
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:34,200
Then surely I'll do the same

23
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:37,512
Confined in mountain halls

24
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:40,633
We got too close to the flame

25
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:46,921
Calling out father hold fast and we will

26
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:52,909
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

27
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:59,089
Desolation comes upon the sky

28
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:05,933
Now I see fire, inside the mountain

29
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:11,925
I see fire, burning the trees

30
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:18,285
I see fire, hollowing souls

31
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,840
I see fire, blood in the breeze

32
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:30,376
And I hope that you'll remember me

33
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,524
And if the night is burning

34
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:36,289
I will cover my eyes

35
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,905
For if the dark returns then

36
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,510
My brothers will die

37
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:46,005
And as the sky's falling down

38
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,167
It crashed into this lonely town

39
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,150
And with that shadow upon the ground

40
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,365
I hear my people screaming out

41
00:03:55,417 --> 00:04:01,385
Now I see fire, inside the mountain

42
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:08,145
I see fire, burning the trees

43
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:14,293
I see fire, hollowing souls

44
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:20,794
I see fire, blood in the breeze

45
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:26,519
I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)

46
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:33,194
I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)

47
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:39,161
And I see fire (fire)

48
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:46,186
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
